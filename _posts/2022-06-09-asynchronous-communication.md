title: Asynchronous communication and how to be effective with it
---

# Introduction

If you weren't working remotely before 2020, that most certainly changed when the pandemic struck and turned the world upside-down for many of us.
This meant no more coffee breaks with your colleagues, no more problems with booking conference rooms for a meeting (that possibly could have been an email), but also - no more "hey, could you please help me with that issue" said to your colleague sitting right next to you[^1]. Remote work is different, and can be challenging, especially for engineers that are just starting in the field. However, remote-first approach opens the doors to a wonderful world of asynchronous communication.

After reading this post, you should know what asynchronous communication is, how to embrace it and what the key of good asynchronous communication is (Spoiler: It’s not the tools!)

# What exactly is asynchronous communication?

When something is asynchronous, one side of the process - the one that provides inputs - doesn't wait for the other side to finish processing that input before heading off to their next task. In the context of communication, email is asynchronous. SMS is too. So are the text (and voice) messaging applications, e.g. Slack.
On the opposite end of the spectrum we have synchronous communication, which is what we know from face-to-face, in-person meetings, or video calls. While synchronous communication methods can't be used to communicate asynchronously, people that are used to in-person interactions tend to misuse means of asynchronously communication to achieve what they think is normal, to them. But it seems counterproductive, doesn't it?

# Why is asynchronous communication important in remote-first world?

When working in the office, there are always some distractions. However, they are usually work-related. You’ll hear people talking in open space, or maybe someone wants to know your opinion about X, because you’re the expert, etc. With those distractions there, most of us can still do their work effectively. However, when working from home, you may not have a “work-first” environment. A lot of us have children, pets, or just want to zone out or cook a meal (because you left the city center in favor of countryside house - you saved some time on commutes, but now, there’s no food delivery…).

And now, when others see you in their messaging tool-of-choice, reaching out to you is as easy as clicking on your name, typing some words, and hitting enter. You may feel obliged to run to the computer, and respond. Relax, the world is not on fire. If it was, an app on your phone (or pager, if you’re that oldschool!) would page you (probably, about yet another us-east-1 downtime). Trying to be there, all the time, is unhealthy and may lead to burnout. Home is not an office.

So, what should you do then? Let’s see how people communicate first, and then I’ll introduce you to how you can make that situation better, for yourself and everyone else.

# How does the communication look like, usually?

At Container Solutions, we have colleagues all around the world, in multiple time zones. This is not unusual, as the globalization made a lot of organizations follow the same approach. All of these organizations use different tools to facilitate interactions between people. The two, most used types are:

* video call/conferencing software, e.g. Zoom
* text messaging, e.g. Microsoft Teams

However, there's also a third, very much important category - knowledge sharing platforms. Either wiki-like (Confluence) or more flexible, non-document oriented ones (Miro) can, and should be used to enable sharing information, that is there to stay. The applications from the last category are great enablers for cherishing asynchronous communication culture.
But, all of these are only tools. Introducing them in your organization won't make you, and people around you, effective communicators.

# Becoming effective in asynchronous communication world

### It’s not about the tools

“So, if the tools won't make me good, what will?” It's all about culture, and a lot of practice. If you want people to communicate asynchronously, everyone has to change the way they think. This means, no more "hello, how are you" and silence on text chats[^2]. Provide context, as much as possible. If you need information, ask directly, but express yourself clearly and try to put context up-front. If you need inputs from people, let them know in your message. Don't leave room for assumptions and understatements. The person, that you're chatting with, is going to reply when they have time, and the last thing you want them to do is to ask about a very important detail that you omitted, when they respond couple of hours later.

### Asynchronous communication when discussion is not enough

“Wait, but not everything can just be a short discussion…” you may say. True, but these bigger topics can still be handled asynchronously. There we want to use aforementioned knowledge sharing platforms. When doing that:

* Define the problem.
* Describe what you think needs to be done by people involved in that work area, and put it there too. For instance, create an action items list in the same confluence page that describes the issue you're trying to solve.

Do above with as much clarity as possible. If you need to, set the due date for the work, define it in the document too, and stick to it. Once the document is “ready”, send it out. But don't wait forever, this is not a document you send to the tax office. It can, and will be refined over time. Let people know what the goals are and what you expect from them.

### You can’t avoid synchronous communication, though

Well, not everything can be done asynchronously. Whether something is too big and can't be easily broken down into smaller pieces, or is too ambiguous, it may actually be easier to meet and talk about it. Schedule a meeting then, don't be afraid of those. The goal is not to get rid of all of them, it's only to limit them to bare-minimum.

# The key is conscious overcommunication

All that I just described can be described as "conscious overcommunication". The more information you provide in your communications up-front, the easier it will be for everyone to react, without going back-and-forth with questions. Don't be afraid of sharing too much (unless it's confidential). As long as you’re not writing about blue being blue and red being red, every piece of information may help the other parties understanding your problem without extra effort.

# Implementing asynchronous communication at your place

Start slowly. Don’t cancel all meetings that you have in you calendar. The next time you want to schedule one, ask yourself - does it have to be a meeting? Instead, you can write up a Request for Comments doc and share it with the stakeholders. Try it out. Everyone will be happy to have all the information for future reference. It’s better, than going back to meeting notes that may lack some of the context. Or maybe, you have a question that doesn’t need to be answered now? Don’t ask for a “quick chat”, think what you would want to ask, add context and send it out. Just like that.

Above may sound easy and logical, but it’s never as easy as it sounds. To be effective, you’ll need a lot of practice. But, you'll get there, eventually. And then everyone will be living a happier life, without having to be 24/7 online responding to Slack messages, or attending meetings about issues, that could have been resolved differently, and, at everyone’s pace.
